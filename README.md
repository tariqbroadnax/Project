This project is 2D game and editor implemented in java. So far, it only uses swing and java2d but I
will eventually begin using SWT and libgdx.

Currently working on the editor.

Update 2/13/17
Currently debugging editor and filling in missing parts before moving forward. Thinking of removing ripped icons and making my own.
