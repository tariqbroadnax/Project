This project is 2D game and editor implemented in java. So far, it only uses swing and java2d but I
will eventually begin using SWT and libgdx.

The editor is heavily inspired by eclipse. Eclipse is a really good editor and heavily recommend.

There is a bunch of networking code that needs to be deleted because the scope of the project changed.

Not all classes are used and some need to be deleted.
